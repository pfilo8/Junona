Fraud detection using Cost Sensitive methods

Fraud detection represents class of binary classification problems however its characterization distinguishes it from the standard ones. The main difference is fact that cost of misclassification between these two are different and whatâ€™s more this cost in fraud detection heavily depends on case. This leads us to very sophisticated problem where standard metrics and models are not enough. During my talk I will present two different approaches to modeling which optimize cost-dependent metrics. The first one is cost dependent classification which takes into account cost of making mistake after standard training process and may be represented by Threshold Optimization and Bayesian Minimum Risk methods. The second one is cost sensitive modeling where models are modifications of standard ones such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees by considering cost of misclassification during training phase. Lastly, I will present results and conclusions from an experiment made on credit card fraud detection dataset which compares all mentioned methods.
